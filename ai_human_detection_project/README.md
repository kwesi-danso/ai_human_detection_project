# AI vs Human Text Classification App

This is a machine learning, deep learning web application that detects whether a given text was written by a **human** or generated by **AI**. It uses 3 traditional ML models (SVM, Decision Tree, and AdaBoost) and tree deep learning models (CNN, lstm, and RNN) which has been trained on preprocessed textual data.

The app was also built with **Streamlit** for interactive, real-time predictions.

## 🚀 Features of app

- 🔮 **Single Prediction** — Paste text or type manually to classify as AI or Human.
- 📁 **Batch Processing** — Upload `.txt`, `.csv`, `.pdf`, or `.docx` files for bulk predictions.
- ⚖️ **Model Comparison** — Compare outputs and confidence scores across the 3 models.
- 📊 **Confidence Visuals** — Real-time prediction probabilities with bar charts.
- 📥 **Download Reports** — Export predictions to CSV.
- 🧠 **Model Info** — This talks about the models architectures, vectorization, training processes and setup.

## 🛠 Installation 1(hosted and deployed Setup)

The app is deployed and availabe at: https://ai-human.streamlit.app/

## 🛠 Installation 2(Local Setup)


1. The app has been deployed to the url:  https://ai-human-detection-update.streamlit.app


2. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kwesi-danso/ai_human_detection_project.git


    You can also move to the number 3 and start if you have the zip of the project.

   ```


3. Create a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate # on Windows
   source venv/bin/activate # on macOS

4. Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the app
   streamlit run app.py

NB: There is a video demo on how to run the project and see the fucntionalities of the app.
