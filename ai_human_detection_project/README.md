# AI vs Human Text Classification App

This is a machine learning web application that detects whether a given text was written by a **human** or generated by **AI**. It uses 3 traditional ML models (SVM, Decision Tree, and AdaBoost) which has been trained on preprocessed textual data.

The app was also built with **Streamlit** for interactive, real-time predictions.

## 🚀 Features of app

- 🔮 **Single Prediction** — Paste text or type manually to classify as AI or Human.
- 📁 **Batch Processing** — Upload `.txt`, `.csv`, `.pdf`, or `.docx` files for bulk predictions.
- ⚖️ **Model Comparison** — Compare outputs and confidence scores across the 3 models.
- 📊 **Confidence Visuals** — Real-time prediction probabilities with bar charts.
- 📥 **Download Reports** — Export predictions to CSV.
- 🧠 **Model Info** — This talks about the models architectures, vectorization, training processes and setup.

## 🛠 Installation 1(hosted and deployed Setup)

The app is deployed and availabe at: https://ai-human.streamlit.app/

## 🛠 Installation 2(Local Setup)

1. **Clone the repo**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kwesi-danso/ai_human_detection_project.git


    You can also move to the number 2 and start if you have the zip of the project.

   ```

2. Create a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate # on Windows
   source venv/bin/activate # on macOS

3. Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the app
   streamlit run app.py

NB: There is a video demo on how to run the project and see the fucntionalities of the app.
